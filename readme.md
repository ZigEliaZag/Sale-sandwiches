# Sales Sandwiches 

This is a command-line-based Python program to handle data automation for a fiction sandwich company. 

Sales sandwiches runs a local market stall, selling a small range of sandwiches. For each market day, their staff pre-make stock to sell, if the sell out of a particuler sandwich, their staff make extra for their costumers. And the unsold one are thrown away at the end of the day. 

This Python program will collect the company's market day sales data, calculate the surplus for the day, and produce recommendation for the number of each sandwich to make for the next market.

The goal is to save the company staff time by automating a repetitive task, and help reduce the surplus by better predicting sales for future markets.

To achieve this, I will wire up my python program to interact with Google Sheet, so that i can push and pull data to and from the spreadsheet. 

* Setting up my virtual inveroment.
* I will be working working with 3.12 Python version 
* I'm going install in some models,(check "requirement.txt" file above
* I'm going to set up a Google Sheet with data to work with
   * To archeive this, I must have a Google acount
